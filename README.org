* Houdini Cpp Wrangle 

  This Houdini node allows you to write wrangle nodes in C++ instead of VEX.

  VEX is an amazing tool for prototyping and fast production, however it is quite simplistic and sometimes broken language. Writing wrangle nodes in C++ brings the full expressive power of C++ and access to HDK(Houdini C++ API) in the expense of slow compilation times compared to VEX. 

  To make the transition from VEX to C++ as simple as possible, we provide C++ implementation of VEX functions. Therefore you can write almost the same code in C++ as you would write it with VEX.
