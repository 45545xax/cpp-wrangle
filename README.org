* Houdini C++ Wrangle 

  This Houdini node allows you to write wrangle nodes in C++ instead of VEX.

  VEX is an amazing tool for prototyping and fast production, however it is quite simplistic and sometimes broken language. Writing wrangle nodes in C++ brings the full expressive power of C++ and access to HDK(Houdini C++ API) in the expense of slow compilation times compared to VEX. 

  To make the transition from VEX to C++ as simple as possible, we provide C++ implementation of VEX functions. Therefore you can write almost the same code in C++ as you would write it with VEX.


** Original idea

   This node is an extension of the node made by [[https://vimeo.com/171189268][animatrix]]. My version should be easier to use for people experienced with VEX.

* Installation and Requirements

  To use C++ Wrangle download this repository and modify =hcustom= to support =c++17=. Right now, it has been tested only with Houdini 17.0 and gcc-8.1.

  To download this repository run the standard command where ever you like
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/lecopivo/cpp-wrangle.git
  #+END_SRC

  Next, find =hcustom= in =<path/to/houdini>/bin/=, the default directory is =/opt/hfs17.0/bin/=, and change lines

  from
  ~set CCFLAGS="$CCFLAGS -std=c++14"~
  to 
  ~set CCFLAGS="$CCFLAGS -std=c++17"~

  and
  
  from
  ~set WFLAGS	= "-Wall -W -Wno-parentheses -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-reorder -Wno-uninitialized -Wunused -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-local-typedefs"~
  to 
  ~set WFLAGS	= "-Wall -W -Wno-parentheses -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-reorder -Wno-uninitialized -Wunused -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-local-typedefs -Wno-ignored-attributes -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-comment -Wno-int-in-bool-context -Wno-misleading-indentation"~

  This can be done by running the following commands in the directory where =hcustom= is
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  cp hcustom hcustom_backup          # backup old hcustom 
  sed -i 's/c++14/c++17/g' hcustom
  sed -i 's/no-unused-local-typedefs"/no-unused-local-typedefs -Wno-ignored-attributes -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-comment -Wno-int-in-bool-context -Wno-misleading-indentation"/g' hcustom
  #+END_SRC

  To test if everything is working, just open up the scene in =cpp-wrangle/houdini/hip/examples.hipnc= and you should be greeted by the colorful pig:
  [[file:img/colorful_pig.png]]
  Houdini will freeze for couple of seconds 

** Enabling finite element module `houfem`

   To enable finite element functions you have to do a little bit more work. Go to directory =cpp-wrangle/houdini/cpp/houfem= and build the module with the following commands
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   mkdir build; cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../..
   make install
   #+END_SRC

   To test the finite element module, open the example scene, =cpp-wrangle/houdini/hip/examples.hipnc=,

* Slow compilation

  Yeah, I know...is sucks :( The compilation is really slow. But the power of c++ and HDK over VEX is worth it in many situations. The general strategy is to untick =Continuous Recompile= during development and force compilation only manually with button =Recompile=. Once you are done with the development, tick =Continuous Recompile= back on, this will automatically compile and load the c++ code.

* Three Modules

** cppvex
   C++ impelementation of VEX functions
** hougen
   connection between Houdini and Eigen
** houfem
   finite element library
